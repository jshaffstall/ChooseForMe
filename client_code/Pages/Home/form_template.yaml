      \ choices into a list and ask the site to choose for you.  You can also have\
      \ multiple lists, in case you need to make similar choices repeatedly.  \n\n\
      To create a list, click the My Lists link above.\n\nYou do not need to login\
      \ to use the site, but if you are not logged in your lists are stored in your\
      \ browser cache.  If you clear your browser cache you will lose your lists.\
      \   Anyone else using your computer can also see your lists.\n\nLogging in allows\
      \ the site to save your lists in the cloud and other people will not be able\
      \ to see your lists.  You will also be able to see your lists from any computer.\n\
      \nIf you cannot decide whether to login or not, create a list with those two\
      \ choices and let the site choose for you!"}
